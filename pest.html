            <h2>Maintain pest control</h2>
          <p>
            1. Routine Inspections Regularly inspect your home or property for
            signs of pests, such as droppings, damage, or nests. Check for
            cracks, holes, or gaps where pests could enter, especially around
            doors and windows. <br> 2. Continued Cleanliness Continue to keep areas
            clean, including floors, counters, and storage areas. Clean up food
            spills or crumbs promptly, as food attracts pests. Ensure food is
            stored in sealed containers. <br> 3. Moisture Control Pests like
            termites, ants, and cockroaches are attracted to moisture. Keep your
            home dry. Fix leaky pipes and install dehumidifiers in damp areas
            such as basements. Ensure proper drainage around your home to
            prevent water accumulation.<br>  4. Seal Entry Points Maintain the
            integrity of seals around doors, windows, and vents. Regularly
            inspect and repair any gaps or cracks in the walls or foundation.
            Consider installing door sweeps and mesh screens on windows. <br> 5.
            Ongoing Pest Barriers Use pest deterrents (like traps, baits, or
            natural repellents) on a routine basis. You can also use essential
            oils (peppermint, lavender, or citronella) as a natural deterrent.<br>
            6. Manage Landscaping Keep trees, shrubs, and plants trimmed away
            from the house to prevent pests from gaining easy access. Remove any
            fallen leaves or organic material that can harbor pests.<br> 7. Regular
            Pest Treatments Schedule periodic treatments with pest control
            professionals, especially if you live in an area prone to
            infestations. Use insecticides or rodenticides sparingly and only
            when necessary, following safety guidelines.<br> 8. Monitor and Respond
            Quickly If you see signs of pests returning, act quickly to prevent
            them from multiplying. If you use traps or bait, replace them
            regularly to ensure their effectiveness.
